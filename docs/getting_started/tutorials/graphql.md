# KubeFox and Hasura

Welcome to the world of KubeFox! This tutorial will walk you through the process
of setting up a Kubernetes cluster using kind ("kind" is **K**ubernetes **in**
**D**ocker), loading KubeFox and Hasura, and working with the technologies.

The tutorial is a hands-on, code-along-with-us introduction to KubeFox Virtual Environments (VEs) with GoLang and Hasura.  In under an hour, you‚Äôll work with a test application in Kubernetes that has multiple backends, see how KubeFox enables developers to rapidly prototype, test different versions of code, and visualize application behavior - without extensive configuration or DevOps overhead.  

You‚Äôll see how KubeFox‚Äôs Virtual Environments empower developers as you spin up what appear to be independent sandboxes.  Behind the scenes, you‚Äôll learn how KubeFox‚Äôs Deployment Distillation and Dynamic Routing work in concert to prevent over-provisioning.  And we‚Äôll finish with some simple modifications to the Virtual Environments themselves, enabling you switch the backend data store you‚Äôre using without deploying anything.

This overview is approachable - even for those relatively new to Kubernetes.

Some quick notes:

1. This tutorial maps to a [CNCF
   Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc6XJFgjocM) we did on March
   13th, 2024. You can follow along with that Livestream if you wish.
2. We very much welcome your feedback. If you encounter any problems or you have
   some suggestions to help make us better, please let us know on [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/xigxog/kubefox/issues).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following tools are installed for this tutorial:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) - A container toolset and
  runtime used to build KubeFox Components' OCI images and run a local
  Kubernetes Cluster via kind.
- [Fox](https://github.com/xigxog/kubefox-cli/releases/) - A CLI for
  communicating with the KubeFox Platform. Installation instructions are below.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) - A distributed version
  control system.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - Package manager for Kubernetes
  used to install the KubeFox Operator on Kubernetes.
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) - **K**uberentes
  **in** **D**ocker. A tool for running local Kubernetes Clusters using Docker
  container "nodes".
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - CLI for communicating
  with a Kubernetes Cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API.
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/) - A terminal based UI to interact
  with your Kubernetes clusters. You can use native kubectl commands to
  accomplish the same things, but k9s is a nice convenience and we use it here.
  By the way, the k9s [homepage](https://k9scli.io/) is probably the cleverest of any
  company in the k8s space, succeeding in that endeavor at many levels.

Here are a few optional but recommended tools:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) - A programming language. The `hello-world`
  example App is written in Go, but Fox is able to compile it even without Go
  installed.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - A lightweight but powerful
  source code editor. Helpful if you want to explore the `hello-world` app.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) -
  CLI for communicating with the Azure control plane.

## Setup Kubernetes

Let's kick things off by setting up a Kubernetes cluster. If you
already have a Kubernetes Cluster provisioned, you can skip this step.

=== "Local (kind)"

    _Note: If you went through the KubeFox Quickstart using kind, we recommend that you
    first delete the cluster you created to ensure that you're starting with a clean
    slate._

    Setup a Kubernetes cluster on your workstation using kind and Docker. Kind
    is an excellent tool specifically designed for quickly establishing a
    cluster for testing purposes.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    kind create cluster --wait 5m
    ```

    ??? example "Output"

        ```text
        Creating cluster "kind" ...
        ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.27.3) üñº
        ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
        ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
        ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
        ‚úì Installing CNI üîå
        ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
        ‚úì Waiting ‚â§ 5m0s for control-plane = Ready ‚è≥
        ‚Ä¢ Ready after 15s üíö
        Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
        You can now use your cluster with:

        kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

        Have a nice day! üëã
        ```

=== "Azure (AKS)"

    Establish a remote Kubernetes cluster on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform
    using the Azure CLI. Keep in mind that creating the specified resources may
    result in costs. Instructions at the end of the tutorial will guide you in
    tearing down all the created resources.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    az login
    ```
    Next set the required variables for this tutorial on Azure.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    export AZ_LOCATION=eastus2 && \
      export AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP=kf-hasura-infra-eus2-rg && \
      export AZ_AKS_NAME=kf-hasura-eus2-aks-01
    ```

    Now you will create a Resource Group for the AKS cluster, and then deploy
    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to the group. The cluster provisioning will
    take several minutes to complete.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    az group create --location $AZ_LOCATION --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP && \
      az aks create \
        --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --tier free \
        --name $AZ_AKS_NAME \
        --location $AZ_LOCATION \
        --generate-ssh-keys \
        --node-count 1 \
        --node-vm-size "Standard_B2s"
    ```
    ??? example "Output"

        ```json
        {
          "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000/resourceGroups/kf-hasura-infra-eus2-rg",
          "location": "eastus2",
          "managedBy": null,
          "name": "kf-hasura-infra-eus2-rg",
          "properties": {
            "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
          },
          "tags": null,
          "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
        }
        ```
        ```text
        ...
        (There is substantially more output but we're truncating for brevity)
        ...
        ```

    Once your AKS cluster is ready add the cluster to your kubectl configuration
    to securely communicate with the Kube API.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    az aks get-credentials \
      --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP  \
      --name $AZ_AKS_NAME
    ```
    ??? info "Asked to overwrite?"

        Were you asked whether you wanted to overwrite items in kubeconfig?  This probably means that you're going throught the tutorial a second time.  Go ahead and answer "y".

        ```text
        A different object named kf-hasura-eus2-aks-01 already exists in your kubeconfig file.
        Overwrite? (y/n): y
        A different object named clusterUser_kf-hasura-infra-eus2-rg_kf-hasura-eus2-aks-01 already exists in your kubeconfig file.
        Overwrite? (y/n): y
        ```

    The last resource to create is the Azure Container Registry (ACR). This is
    used to store the KubeFox Component container images.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    export AZ_ACR_NAME="acr$RANDOM" && \
      az acr create --name $AZ_ACR_NAME --sku Basic --admin-enabled true --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```

          "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries",
          "zoneRedundancy": "Disabled"
        }
        ```

    Set the registry endpoints and token to access the registry. These
    environment variables are used by Fox to push container images to ACR.

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    export FOX_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=$(az acr show-endpoints \
        --name $AZ_ACR_NAME \
        --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --output tsv \
        --query loginServer) && \
      export FOX_REGISTRY_TOKEN=$(az acr login \
        --name $AZ_ACR_NAME \
        --expose-token \
        --output tsv \
        --query accessToken) && \
      export FOX_REGISTRY_USERNAME="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    ```

## Setup KubeFox

In this step you will install the KubeFox Helm Chart to initiate the KubeFox
Operator on your Kubernetes cluster. The operator manages KubeFox Platforms and
Apps.

```{ .shell .copy }
helm upgrade kubefox kubefox \
  --repo https://xigxog.github.io/helm-charts \
  --create-namespace --namespace kubefox-system \
  --install --wait
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    Release "kubefox" does not exist. Installing it now.
    NAME: kubefox
    LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970
    NAMESPACE: kubefox-system
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    TEST SUITE: None
    ```

## Get the Fox CLI

Now install Fox, a CLI tool used to interact with KubeFox and prepare your Apps
for deployment and release.

=== "Install using Go"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    go install github.com/xigxog/fox@latest
    ```

=== "Install using Bash"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    curl -sL "https://github.com/xigxog/fox/releases/latest/download/fox-$(uname -s | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')-amd64.tar.gz" | \
      tar xvz - -C /tmp && \
      sudo mv /tmp/fox /usr/local/bin/fox
    ```

=== "Install Manually"

    Download the [latest Fox release](https://github.com/xigxog/fox/releases/latest){:target="_blank"} for your OS and extract the `Fox` binary to a directory on your path.

## Set up the Tutorial

Awesome! You're all set to start the KubeFox Platform on the your newly created
cluster and deploy your first KubeFox Hasura GraphQL App. To begin, create a new
directory and use Fox to initialize the `graphql` App. Run all subsequent
commands from this directory. The environment variable `FOX_INFO` tells Fox to
to provide additional output about what is going on. Employ the `--graphql` flag
to simplify setting things up for this tutorial.

```{ .shell .copy }
mkdir kubefox-graphql && \
  cd kubefox-graphql && \
  export FOX_INFO=true && \
  fox init --graphql
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    info    Configuration successfully written to '/home/xadhatter/.config/kubefox/config.yaml'.

    info    Waiting for KubeFox Platform 'demo' to be ready...
    info    KubeFox initialized for the GraphQL tutorial!
    ```

## Load Hasura

Now we want to load Hasura into the cluster.

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl apply -f hack/hasura.yaml --namespace kubefox-demo
```
??? example "Output"

    ```text
    pod/hasura-prod created
    service/hasura-prod created
    pod/hasura-dev created
    service/hasura-dev created
    pod/hasura-john created
    service/hasura-john created
    ```
Note that it can take some time for the pods to spin up.  You may also see the
Pods in not-quite-ready state, but give them some time and they'll come up.
Check on them and ensure that they're ready before proceeding.

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl get pods -A
```
??? example "Output"
    ```text

    You might see something like this initially:

Once the Pods are up, we can start working with KubeFox and Hasura in earnest!

## Define Environments

We're first going to establish some KubeFox Environments and Virtual
Environments. Let's take a quick look at the environment YAML.  Open `dev.yaml`
in VS Code.  It's in the hack/environments folder in kubefox-graphql:

```yaml linenums="9"
---
apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  releasePolicy:
    type: Testing
data:
  vars:
    db: dev
    #subPath: dev
---
apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualEnvironment
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  environment: dev
---
apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualEnvironment
metadata:
  name: dev-john
spec:
  environment: dev
data:
  vars:
    db: john
    subPath: john
```

Let's review some parts of these resources.

Think of the Environment as a parent of Virtual Environments (we'll call Virtual
Environments "VEs" for short).  Environment variables defined in the Environment
resource will be inherited by VEs, but can also be overridden in VEs.  The
Environment is largely a convenience, relieving you from defining the same
values repeatedly in the VEs (e.g., DB connection strings).  

VEs map to Environments using the spec: environment: value - in this case `dev`.
Each of these VEs - `dev` and `dev-john` - inherit the values from the dev
Environment.  The dev-john VE overrides the value of the `db` environment value
to `john`.  We'll discuss the `subPath` value in a momment.

As you can see, multiple VEs can be defined within an Environment. You'll see
later how - when coupled with KubeFox's Dynamic Routing - VEs are one of
KubeFox's superpowers.

Let's load the environment resources (we have two of them - `dev` and `prod`) into our cluster:

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl apply -f hack/environments/ --namespace kubefox-demo
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev created
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev created
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev-john created
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod created
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod created
    ```

Great!  So we've created two Environments, `dev` and `prod`.  In the prod Environment, we have
one VE: `prod`.  And in the dev Environment, we have two VEs: `dev` and `dev-john`.  Let's chat
about the subPath value referenced above.

Open our App component - `main.go`.  It's in the components/server subdirectory of
kubefox-graphql. Scroll to line 40 and you'll see the following:

```go linenums="41"
k.Static("/{{.Vars.subPath}}/hasura/static", "static", EFS)
k.Route("Path(`/{{.Vars.subPath}}/hasura/heroes`)", listHeroes)
k.Route("PathPrefix(`/{{.Vars.subPath}}/hasura`)", forwardHasura)
```
KubeFox has the ability to inject routing information at runtime.  It will pull
the subPath value from the VE (which may be inherited from the Environment) and
inject it where you see `{{.Vars.subPath}}`.  You'll see this in action in a
moment, but to send a request to a deployment in the `dev` VE, we'd use an URL
with a subpath of `dev` as that is what is defined in the dev VE above:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/diagrams/hasura_tutorial/sample_url_subpath_kf-dep_kf-ve.svg" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 1. Sample URL with subPath, deployment and VE</figcaption>
</figure>

These are the features of the URL shown in Figure 1 above:<br/>
(a) - The `dev` subPath is specified, which should match the subPath in the
 VE to which we want the request routed (in this case, `dev`)<br/>
(b) - The `graphql-main` deployment is specified<br/>
(c) - The `dev` VE is specified<br/>

It's worthwhile to note here that in KubeFox, there can be multiple versions of
an App with multiple versions of components running in the same cluster.
KubeFox has strict rules for determining what the target deployment is.  Once a
request has been identified at origin (a Genesis Event in KubeFox), KubeFox will
ensure that the request is interacting only with App components that were part
of the specific version of the deployment being referenced.

Scroll up a bit to line 38, and you'll see the following:

```go linenums="38"
graphqlAdapter = k.HTTPAdapter("graphql")
hasuraAdapter = k.HTTPAdapter("hasura")
``` 

These two lines define dependencies for components that must be present for us
to successfully run our App.

## Initial Deployment

It's time to do our first deployment!  When you deploy in KubeFox, you don't
spend time trying to identify the components that changed and work through CI/CD
nuances.  You simply tell KubeFox to deploy, and KubeFox determines what needs
to be deployed.

```{ .shell .copy }
export FOX_INFO=True && \
fox publish --wait 5m 
```

=== "Local (kind)"

=== "Azure (AKS)"

    ??? info "Fox publish error?"

        Did you receive an error with 'fox publish'?  For example:

        ```text
        error	üòñ Error building container image: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
        ```
        or

        ```text
        info	Building component image 'acr5941.azurecr.io/graphql/server:a6fee36f3aed5bef8e4b482821fc4098'.
        info	Pushing component image to registry 'acr5941.azurecr.io/graphql/server:a6fee36f3aed5bef8e4b482821fc4098'.
        info	Loading component image 'acr5941.azurecr.io/graphql/server:a6fee36f3aed5bef8e4b482821fc4098' into kind cluster 'kind'.
        error	ERROR: no nodes found for cluster "kind"
        error	üòñ Error loading component image into kind: exit status 1
        ```

        This is usually an indication that you've used the Fox CLI previously with a different cluster, e.g., kind.  To correct the error, we can set the configuration for the Fox CLI as follows:

        ```{ .shell .copy }
          fox config setup \
          --registry-address $FOX_REGISTRY_ADDRESS \
          --registry-token $FOX_REGISTRY_TOKEN \
          --registry-username $FOX_REGISTRY_USERNAME
        ```

        Answer "n" to the prompt:

        ```text
        Are you only using KubeFox with local kind cluster? [y/N]
        ```

        And rerun the publish:

        ```{ .shell .copy }
          fox publish --wait 5m
        ```

??? example "Output"

    ```text

    ```
What KubeFox did here was to inspect the repository, determine what changed,
build container(s) for those components that are new or which changed, push
those containers to a container registry (e.g., GHCR, ACR, a local registry etc.) and
build an AppDeployment based upon that process.  The AppDeployment is a custom
resource that the KubeFox Operator leverages to bring the AppDeployment online.

In the Output, you can also see the routes we defined in our App (in the
`routes:` section), and the Adapter dependencies we specified (in the
`dependencies:` section).

Let's jump over to k9s for the rest our evaluation of the cluster.  If you don't
see the Pods section as shown in Figure 2 below, then type 
```text
:pods
```
 or 
```text
:pods -n = kubefox-demo
```
into k9s.  You can also set the namespace in k9s by typing the number
corresponding to the namespace you wish to view.  We want to review
kubefox-demo, so that would be ++1++ (you can see the namespaces in pink left of
center in the screen in Figure 2).

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s Initial Publish.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 2 - Pods display after Fox publish</figcaption>
</figure>

A few things to note:

1. We've deployed our App - `graphql-server` - once, and we have a single Pod
   running.
2. There are 3 Pods running with 3 different databases:

    1.  `hasura-dev` - Traffic to the `dev` VE will be routed to this database
    2.  `hasura-john` - Traffic to the `dev-john` VE will be routed to this database
    3.  `hasura-prod` - Traffic to the `prod` VE will be routed to this database

Typically, connections to KubeFox Apps are made through a public-facing load
balancer. To keep things simple for purposes of this tutorial, we'll use the Fox
CLI to create a local proxy instead. Note that we're going to leave the proxy
running, so it's important to start it in a new terminal window.  

In a new terminal window run the following command:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox proxy 8080
```

??? info "macOS Network Warning"

    <figure markdown>
      <img src="../../images/fox-mac-net-warn.png" width=75% height=75%>
      <figcaption>macOS Warning</figcaption>
    </figure>

    If you are using macOS you might notice this dialog popup when you start the
    proxy. This is expected as Fox starts a local HTTP server. The server is
    bound to the `localhost` interface and is only accessible from your
    workstation. Please press `Allow` to continue.

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    HTTP proxy started on http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

## Diagnosing a 400

Now, switch back to the original terminal window and run the following curl
command:

```{ .shell .copy }
curl -v "http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-main&kf-ve=dev"
```

??? example "Output"

    ```

Huh.  We received an HTTP 400 - Bad Request.  Why?

KubeFox is telling us that it cannot fulfill the request because the event
context is invalid:

```text
invalid: event context is invalid
```

A little further down, we can see the reasons.  The first error is:

```text
message: Var "subPath" not found but is required.
```

So KubeFox saw that the request specified a subPath of `dev`, as illustrated in
Figure 1 above, but that subPath is not defined in the `dev` VE.

The second thing is that our Adapters have not been defined:

```text
message: Component "server" dependency "graphql" of type "HTTPAdapter" not found.
message: Component "server" dependency "hasura" of type "HTTPAdapter" not found.
```

Adapters are responsible for translating back and forth between KubeFox events and some
external protocol - in this case, HTTP. KubeFox performs this translation at
runtime, which enables it to route dynamically at runtime.  You'll see this in
action in a moment, when we dynamically select GraphQL endpoints without
modifying any code..

Let's fix our problems, starting with the HTTP adapters.

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl apply -f hack/http-adapter.yaml --namespace kubefox-demo
```

??? example "Output"
    ```text
    httpadapter.kubefox.xigxog.io/graphql created
    httpadapter.kubefox.xigxog.io/hasura created
    ```
We need to come clean; we cheated a bit here for purposes of illustration.  If
you review the original deployment, reprinted here (under Output below) for convenience, KubeFox
told us that problems were present when we tried to publish.  KubeFox could not
resolve the dependencies for the Adapters, and it told us so.

??? example "Output"

    ```

Now let's fix the subPath problem. Open dev.yaml (located in hack/environments).
Do see the problem?

```yaml linenums="9" hl_lines="12"
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Environment
  metadata:
    name: dev
  spec:
    releasePolicy:
      type: Testing
  data:
    vars:
      db: dev
      subPath: dev
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: VirtualEnvironment
  metadata:
    name: dev
  spec:
    environment: dev
  ---
```

Neither the Environment nor the VE specify subPath (the subPath in the
Environment is commented out). Uncomment it, save the file, and reapply the
environment YAML: 

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl apply -f hack/environments/ --namespace kubefox-demo
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev created
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev created
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev-john created
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod created
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod created
    ```

## Accessing Deployments

Okay - let's retry our curl command:

```{ .shell .copy }
curl -v "http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-main&kf-ve=dev"
```

And voila!  Success! A very long HTML page.

    ```

This will look a lot better if we view it in a browser, so click on the URL
below:

[http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-main&kf-ve=dev](http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-main&kf-ve=dev){:target="_blank"} 

This is what you should see:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Initial Superheroes HTML page.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 3 - The Superheroes HTML Page in FireFox</figcaption>
</figure>

The initial request was successful, but the page sure doesn't look pretty.

If we look under the covers, we see that while the content is correct and the
initial request was fine, subsequent requests made by the browser lacked the
KubeFox context for the deployment and VE (to see this view, right click and
click `inspect`, select `Network`, refresh the page, and click on the 404 message):

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Initial Superheroes HTML page with 404 for CSS styles.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 4 - The Superheroes HTML Page with 404 Detail</figcaption>
</figure>

We can fix this in one of two ways:

1. We can launch the Fox proxy with context.   Go to the terminal where you
   launched the Fox proxy, do a ++ctrl+c++ to stop it, then restart it with context:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox proxy --virtual-env dev --app-deployment graphql-main 8080
```

When we specify the deployment and VE in the Fox proxy, it will take care of the
injection of the deployment and VE for us.  So we can use an undecorated URL -
one without query parameters (we'll use copy/paste this time so you can paste
the URL on the same page where you had the Inspector active):

```{ .shell .copy }
http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes
```

Try it and you should see this:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Initial Superheroes HTML page with fox proxy context.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 5 - The Superheroes HTML Page with Fox proxy context</figcaption>
</figure>

2. The second and simpler way to correct this though is to make a release.
   First, let's change the Fox proxy back to the generic flavor.  ++ctrl+c++ the Fox proxy with context, then restart it as follows:

```{ .shell .copy }
  fox proxy 8080
```

## Creating a Release

Now let's create a release:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox release graphql-main --virtual-env dev
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text

    apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
    data: {}
    details: {}
    kind: VirtualEnvironment
    metadata:

      finalizers:

      labels:

      namespace: kubefox-demo
      resourceVersion: "42792"
      uid: 32f05b08-a832-4700-9a95-6e9757295ff8
    spec:
      environment: dev
      release:
        apps:
          graphql:
            appDeployment: graphql-main
    status:
      activeRelease:
        activationTime: "2024-03-26T01:31:05Z"
        apps:
          graphql:
            appDeployment: graphql-main
        id: 6e211510-388e-4514-ac50-970795d749c4
        requestTime: "2024-03-26T01:31:05Z"
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2024-03-26T01:31:05Z"
        message: Release AppDeployments are available, Routes and Adapters are valid and
          compatible with the VirtualEnv.
        observedGeneration: 2
        reason: ContextAvailable
        status: "True"
        type: ActiveReleaseAvailable
      - lastTransitionTime: "2024-03-25T19:07:18Z"
        message: Release was activated.
        observedGeneration: 2
        reason: ReleaseActivated
        status: "False"
        type: ReleasePending
        
    ```

When we release, KubeFox defaults all traffic to that subPath to the
currently-released version of the App. We released to the `dev` VE, so when
KubeFox sees the undecorated URL with a subpath of `dev`, it will inject context for
us. Refresh the page and you should see the same results in your browser:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page post release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 6 - The Superheroes HTML Page after release</figcaption>
</figure>

We can have one release per App per VE.  So if we had 4 different Apps, each of
them could be released once to a particular VE.

Using Release is actually recommended.  It's more convenient for developers and
QA staff, and the URLs don't need to be decorated with query parameters, so the
same test suites can be run iteratively for rapid prototyping etc.

## Dynamic Routing

Remember that we started with three VEs:  `dev` and `dev-john` in the dev
environment, and `prod` in the prod environment.  We just created a release for
our `dev` VE.  To illustrate the power of KubeFox's Dynamic Routing, we're going
to create releases for each of our remaining VEs, `dev-john` and `prod`.

First we'll release to the dev-john VE:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox release graphql-main --virtual-env dev-john
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text

    apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1

        requestTime: "2024-03-26T01:58:44Z"
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2024-03-26T01:58:44Z"
        message: Release AppDeployments are available, Routes and Adapters are valid and
          compatible with the VirtualEnv.
        observedGeneration: 2
        reason: ContextAvailable
        status: "True"

        message: Release was activated.
        observedGeneration: 2
        reason: ReleaseActivated
        status: "False"
        type: ReleasePending

    ```

Now we're going to release to prod, but before we do, let's discuss some fundamental differences
between the prod environment and the dev environment.  If we look back at the dev
environment (open `dev.yaml` in VS Code - you'll find it in the hack/environments folder
in kubefox-graphql).  You'll see a releasePolicy defined as type: Testing.

```yaml linenums="9" hl_lines="8"
---
apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  releasePolicy:
    type: Testing
data:
  vars:
    db: dev
    subPath: dev
---
```

A Testing release policy enables release without requiring excessive formality,
thereby reducing overhead.  In prod however, we want formality.  We want
releases to be versioned and immutable.  It is good practice to ensure that
prod releases can be reproduced at any point in the future, something that is
actually required for compliance purposes, for instance, in the medical device space.

When we look at the prod.yaml, we see a releasePolicy defined as type: Stable.  That
compels us to add some essential steps to a production release.

```yaml linenums="9" hl_lines="8"
---
apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: prod
spec:
  releasePolicy:
    type: Stable
data:
  vars:
    db: prod
    subPath: prod
---
```

Just for grins, let's try to do a release to prod in the same manner as we did
for dev:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox release graphql-main --virtual-env prod
```

Take a look at the response:

    ```

KubeFox cannot release the App because the version is not set:

```text
message: Version is required but not set for App "graphql".
```

Okay, so let's tag the repository and publish a versioned copy of the
App based upon that tag:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox publish --version v1 --create-tag
```

We receive an immediate error:

```text
error	üòñ Error finding commit hash: uncommitted changes present
```

KubeFox ensures that when we try to publish to a VE that has a Stable
release policy, that we're publishing what we intend to publish.  The deployment
must be versioned and built from a tag in the repository (KubeFox helps with
that as you can see above).  

Concerning the uncommitted changes message - remember that KubeFox works from
the repository outward. We discussed the fact that KubeFox inspects the
repository, detects changes, and publishes only those changes that it finds. In
so doing, KubeFox eliminates redundant deployments and controls provisioning.
However, if uncommitted changes are present, KubeFox will halt the publish
operation until that situation is resolved in the repository.

Remember that we made a change earlier to uncomment subPath in dev.yaml?  That's
the pending change with which we need to deal before we can publish.  In our case, let's simply commit the changes and republish:

```{ .shell .copy }
git add . && \
git commit -m "fixed VE" && \
fox publish --version v1 --create-tag
```

    ```

We've now complied with our release policy by tagging and versioning the deployment.

## Deployment Distillation

It's worthwhile to take a closer look at the top of the deployment, where you
can see this message:

```text
info	Component image 'localhost/kubefox/graphql/server:a6fee36f3aed5bef8e4b482821fc4098' exists, skipping build.
```

Again, KubeFox works from the repository outward.  It inspected the
component, determined it had not changed and continued with the deployment.
This is a common occurrence when working with a KubeFox App.  It is not
incumbent on the developer, QA or build staff to determine what has changed and
modify CI/CD accordingly.  Instead, staff can simply publish the App as a monolith; KubeFox determines what components have changed or been added, and builds and deploys only those modified and/or new containers. Besides being an enormous timesaver, this approach lends itself to far
greater accuracy during development cycles.  Additionally, provisioning is 
controlled in an automated and seamless manner.

KubeFox did create a new AppDeployment, with the name `graphql-v1`:

```text hl_lines="14"
    kind: AppDeployment
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: "2024-03-26T02:39:39Z"

Let's jump over to k9s and see what we have.

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s After Publish to prod.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 7 - View of Pods after Publish to prod</figcaption>
</figure>

We've deployed to dev, dev-john and prod - but we still have only one
graphql-server application Pod. KubeFox can satisfy all requests for each of
these deployments with a single Pod due to its dynamic routing.

Let's take a look at our AppDeployments.  On k9s, type `:appdeployments`.

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s AppDeployments after publish to prod.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 7 - View of AppDeployments after publish to prod</figcaption>
</figure>

We have two AppDeployments:

1. `graphql-main` - the development version of our App
2. `graphql-v1` - the production version of our App

Let's take a look at the browser.  First, let's try the dev VE.  

Note: For these next few steps, paste the URL into the same browser where you
have the Inspector active.  That way, you don't need to repeatly activate the Inspector.

```{ .shell .copy }
http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes
```

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page dev VE post release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 8 - Browser view of the dev VE after release</figcaption>
</figure>

Okay, let's try dev-john (remember the subPath for dev-john is `john`).

```{ .shell .copy }
http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes
```

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page dev-john VE post release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 9 - Browser view of the dev-john VE after release</figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, let's try prod.

```{ .shell .copy }
http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes
```

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page prod VE before release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 10 - Browser view of the prod VE pre release</figcaption>
</figure>

Huh.  We get "route not found".  That means that KubeFox could not route the
request. We did not supply query parameters in the URL, so that must mean that
we neglected to perform a release.  If that's true, then we should be able to
access the version in prod by specifying context with query parameters.  Let's try that:

```{ .shell .copy }
http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-v1&kf-ve=prod
```

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page prod VE pre release query parameters.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 11 - Browser view of the prod VE pre release with query parameters</figcaption>
</figure>

Okay - that works.  But we have our 404 errors for the secondary browser
requests. So we just forgot to release.  Let's do that now:

```{ .shell .copy }
fox release v1 --virtual-env prod
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text

    ```

and try our undecorated query in prod again (sometimes this takes a moment or
two - particularly in external clouds).

```{ .shell .copy }
http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes
```

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page prod VE post release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 12 - Browser view of the prod VE post release</figcaption>
</figure>

That's better.

The release process performs a compilation of the routes, and when undecorated
URLs are processed, KubeFox determines the context and automatically injects the
variables for the released version of the App for that VE.

Okay!  Things are about to get really cool.  

You've seen how simple application development can be in KubeFox, how it distills
deployments to only those components that are new or which have changed, and how
it can dynamically route requests at runtime.  Starting from where we're at in
the tutorial - a single component and three VEs, what if - without deploying any
code and without affecting prod - we could shift the data sources? Can you
imagine the implications for testing and for things like intelligent canary
deployments?

Well, we're about to go there.

Let's jump into the Hasura console in the dev-john VE. 

[http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/](http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/){:target="_blank"} 

You should see this:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console initial.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 13 - Hasura console in the dev-john VE</figcaption>
</figure>

There is some simple logic in our main.go component that routes requests to
Hasura. On line 43, you see this code:

```go linenums="43" 
k.Route("PathPrefix(`/{{.Vars.subPath}}/hasura`)", forwardHasura)
```

which tells us that anything that is not 'static' or 'heroes' will be forward to
Hasura, and there is a simple proxy function starting on line 69 to achieve this:

```go linenums="69"
func forwardHasura(k kit.Kontext) error {
  req := k.Forward(hasuraAdapter)
  req.RewritePath(k.PathSuffix())

  resp, err := req.Send()
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  return k.Resp().Forward(resp)
}
```

## Hasura Console Basics

Getting back to Hasura, one of its many value adds is that it inspects the
database and builds a GraphQL interface for you.

For purposes of this tutorial, we're going to focus on the basics to enable you
to see what KubeFox can do, but we encourage you to play around with Hasura. It
is a very powerful product. 

As shown in Figure 14 below:

1. Click the `DATA` menu button at the top of the Hasura console
2. Expand the `> public` folder under the `Superheroes` database on the left
   panel
3. Click the `superhero` table
4. Click the `Try GraphQL` dropdown
5. Click `Query` on the dropdown menu

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console setup for first GraphiQL query.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 14 - Setting up our first GraphQL query</figcaption>
</figure>

Your screen should look like what is shown below in Figure 15.  

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console before first GraphiQL query.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 15 - Initial GraphQL query panel for the superhero table</figcaption>
</figure>

In the bottom center panel - right below the `GraphiQL` text and play button,
there is a query ready for us to execute. Just to get acquainted, click that play
button.  It should look as shown in Figure 16 below.

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console first query.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 16 - Results from our first query</figcaption>
</figure>

Right now, it's returning `alignment_id`, which is not really very helpful.
Alignment, in our superhero world, is whether the superhero is 'good' or
'bad'. What we'd really like to know is exactly that.  So change the query to
look like it does in Figure 17.  Hasura's autocomplete will help you but some
tips:

1. Delete from `alignment_id` to `weight_kg`
2. Type `alignment {` on the line after superhero name (Hasura will add the
   right brace), and hit ++enter++
3. Start typing `alignment` and Hasura will autocomplete for you

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura query with alignment edit.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 17 - Hasura query with alignment edit</figcaption>
</figure>

Run the query again (hit the play button), and you should see this:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura query results after alignment edit.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 18 - Hasura query results after alignment edit</figcaption>
</figure>

Excellent!  Now we're going to go back into the database and modify the
superhero table.  To get there again:

1. Click the `DATA` menu button at the top of the Hasura console
2. Expand the `> public` folder under the `Superheroes` database on the left
   panel
3. Click the `superhero` table

Your screen should look like this:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura browse superhero table.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 19 - Browsing the 'superhero' table in Hasura</figcaption>
</figure>

Click the edit button for `3-D Man`:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console editing 3-D Man.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 20 - Editing 3-D Man in Hasura</figcaption>
</figure>

Type in your own name in the `full_name` field for 3-D Man (Congratulations!
You're a superhero!):

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console after 3-D Man edit.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 21 - You become 3-D Man</figcaption>
</figure>

and save your changes.  Try the URL again.

[http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

You should see that you've become 3-D Man.

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page dev-john VE post 3-D Man edit.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 22 - 3-D Man in the dev-john VE</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's check and see what the dev VE looks like.

[http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page dev VE post 3-D Man edit.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 23 - 3-D Man in the dev VE</figcaption>
</figure>

3-D Man is unchanged.  Why?  The change we made was in the `dev-john` VE, the
`dev` VE is unaffected.  Even though there is only one Pod running for both
releases, KubeFox is dynamically routing requests at runtime.  Developers using
the `dev` VE can use the original data source, and developers using the `dev-john`
VE can work with the new content and queries. To each group, their VEs provide
them with what appear to be independent sandboxes.  All the while, KubeFox is controlling
provisioning by deploying only changed (or new) components - so we're achieving
this with a single instance of our graphql-server component.

## Modifying our App

Let's take this even further.  We'll add gender to the database query using
Hasura, then we'll modify our App to support the additional column.

Start by going back to Hasura.

[http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/](http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/){:target="_blank"} 

You should be here:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console before adding gender.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 24 - Hasura console before adding gender</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's add gender to our query.  To do so:

1. Copy the `alignment` block
2. Change `alignment` to `gender`

The console should look like this:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura console after adding gender.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 25 - Hasura console after adding gender</figcaption>
</figure>

Hit the play button. The console should show these results:

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Hasura query results after gender edit.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 26 - Hasura console showing query results with gender</figcaption>
</figure>

You can see that we've made gender available in our query.  Now we want to
modify our component to obtain and show the update.

Before we make our changes, let's create a feature branch.

```{ .shell .copy }
  git checkout -b feature
```
??? example "Output"

    ```text
    Switched to a new branch 'feature'
    ```

Open main.go in VS Code.  It's in the components/server directory.  On line 48,
you'll see the listHeroes function.

```go linenums="48" hl_lines="1"
  func listHeroes(k kit.Kontext) error {
    client := graphql.New(k, graphqlAdapter)

    // For additional documentation check out
    // https://github.com/hasura/go-graphql-client.
    var query struct {
      Superhero []struct {
        Name      string `graphql:"superhero_name"`
        RealName  string `graphql:"full_name"`
        Alignment struct {
          Value string `graphql:"alignment"`
        }
      } `graphql:"superhero(order_by: {superhero_name: asc})"`
    }
    if err := client.Query(&query, nil); err != nil {
      return err
    }

    return k.Resp().SendHTMLTemplate(tpl, "index.html", query)
  }
```

We want to add gender to our GraphQL query.  To do so, we'll do something very
similar to what we did in the Hasura console:

1. Copy the `Alignment` struct & paste it right beneath itself
2. In the copy, change `Alignment` to `Gender`
3. Change `Value string: 'graphql:"alignment"` to `Value string: 'graphql:"gender"`

It should look like this:

```go linenums="48" hl_lines="13-15"
  func listHeroes(k kit.Kontext) error {
    client := graphql.New(k, graphqlAdapter)

    // For additional documentation check out
    // https://github.com/hasura/go-graphql-client.
    var query struct {
      Superhero []struct {
        Name      string `graphql:"superhero_name"`
        RealName  string `graphql:"full_name"`
        Alignment struct {
          Value string `graphql:"alignment"`
        }
        Gender struct {
          Value string `graphql:"gender"`
        }
      } `graphql:"superhero(order_by: {superhero_name: asc})"`
    }
    if err := client.Query(&query, nil); err != nil {
      return err
    }

    return k.Resp().SendHTMLTemplate(tpl, "index.html", query)
  }
```
Save your changes.

This extends our Go GraphQL query to include gender.  To display it, we need to modify
the HTML page.

The last line in the listHeroes function returns a template:

```go linenums="81" hl_lines="7"
    return k.Resp().SendHTMLTemplate(tpl, "index.html", query)
```

This is a helper function from the KubeFox SDK (kit), which generates HTML based
upon Go templates.

In VS Code, open the index.html template, located in
components/server/templates.  In it, you'll see this table:

```html linenums="27"
  <table class="styled-table">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Real Name</th>
      <th>Alignment</th>
    </tr>
    {{ range .Superhero }}
    <tr>
      <td>{{.Name}}</td>
      <td>{{.RealName}}</td>
      <td>{{.Alignment.Value}}</td>
    </tr>
    {{ end}}
  </table>
```

We just need to add gender.  Modify the table so it looks like this:

```html linenums="27" hl_lines="6 13"
    <table class="styled-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Real Name</th>
        <th>Alignment</th>
        <th>Gender</th>
      </tr>
      {{ range .Superhero }}
      <tr>
        <td>{{.Name}}</td>
        <td>{{.RealName}}</td>
        <td>{{.Alignment.Value}}</td>
        <td>{{.Gender.Value}}</td>
      </tr>
      {{ end}}
    </table>
```

Save your changes.

Finished!  Let's commit our changes:

```{ .shell .copy }
  git add . && \
  git commit -m "Added gender"
```

Now we can do a Fox publish.  We're publishing from our branch.

```{ .shell .copy }
  fox publish --wait 5m
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text hl_lines="1"

It‚Äôs actually going to rebuild the component this time because we made changes
to it.  By default, Fox uses the branch name as part of the
AppDeployment name.  So our AppDeployment name is `graphql-feature`.  Let's jump
over to k9s again and see what we have.

To show Pods, type `:pods` into k9s.

  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s Pods after modifying our App.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 27 - k9s showing our new Pod</figcaption>
</figure>

We needed to build and deploy a new container due to the modifications we made.
You see the newly-created Pod highlighted in Figure 25.

To show AppDeployments, type `:appdeployments` into k9s.

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s AppDeployments after deploying feature branch.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 28 - k9s showing the graphql-feature Appdeployment</figcaption>
</figure>

We have 3 AppDeployments now.  You can see our `graphql-feature` AppDeployment
highlighted in Figure 28.

Let‚Äôs check out the results.  If we go to the dev-john VE and don't provide
query parameters, there should not be a gender column.  

The reason is that we have not yet performed a release - we only published. So
the released version is our original deployment - `graphql-main`.

  <figcaption>Figure 29 - dev-john VE after gender mod but before release</figcaption>
</figure>

The App in dev-john is unchanged.  As it should be.  

Our new deployment with our gender modifications - `graphql-feature` - is running
and we can access it.  We just need to include query parameters on the URL.

[http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-feature&kf-ve=dev-john](http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes?kf-dep=graphql-feature&kf-ve=dev-john){:target="_blank"}

  <figcaption>Figure 30 - dev-john VE after gender mod with query parameters</figcaption>
</figure>

We can release the feature branch to the dev-john VE, and access it without
query parameters.  Let's do that.

```{ .shell .copy }
  fox release graphql-feature --virtual-env dev-john
```

Now we can access our new feature without query parameters.

  <figcaption>Figure 31 - dev-john VE after gender mod and after release</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that we can see the gender column, and we're also looking at the version of
the database that contains our 3-D Man update (you're still a superhero!).

Let's take a look at prod.

[http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

prod is still using the old version of the App with the original database content.

  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page prod VE after gender mod.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 32 - prod VE after gender mod</figcaption>
</figure>

And if we look at dev, it is also using the old version and the original
database content.

[http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"}

  <figcaption>Figure 33 - dev VE after gender mod</figcaption>
</figure>

Normal workflow now would be to checkout main, do a merge and deploy.  With
KubeFox, we simply do a Fox publish.  This operation is going to update the
`graphql-main` AppDeployment (check the AppDeployment name in the output).  

```{ .shell .copy }
  git checkout main && \
  git merge feature && \
  fox publish --wait 5m
```

Because dev is already using the `graphql-main` AppDeployment, we should see that
dev is updated with the new feature.  Let's check it and see.

  <figcaption>Figure 34 - dev VE after merge and publish</figcaption>
</figure>

This demonstrates the flexibility and power of KubeFox to support rapid
prototyping and POC efforts.  You can make changes and redeploy, and the VE will
reflect those changes instantly.  Note that this is only permissable with a
release policy of Testing.

## Exploring KubeFox VEs

To further explore this KubeFox superpower, let's do the following:

1. Modify the `dev.yaml` to change the subPath to `something`.  Remember that it's
   currently inheriting the subPath (`dev`) from the dev Environment.
2. Apply the Environment YAML.
3. Check what we see.

Edit the dev.yaml.  It's in hack/environments and it looks like this:

```yaml linenums="9" 
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Environment
  metadata:
    name: dev
  spec:
    releasePolicy:
      type: Testing
  data:
    vars:
      db: dev
      subPath: dev
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: VirtualEnvironment
  metadata:
    name: dev
  spec:
    environment: dev
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: VirtualEnvironment
  metadata:
    name: dev-john
  spec:
    environment: dev
  data:
    vars:
      db: john
      subPath: john
```

Add a subPath `something` to the dev VE so it looks like this:

```yaml linenums="9" hl_lines="20-22"
    ---
    apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Environment
    metadata:
      name: dev
    spec:
      releasePolicy:
        type: Testing
    data:
      vars:
        db: dev
        subPath: dev
    ---
    apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
    kind: VirtualEnvironment
    metadata:
      name: dev
    spec:
      environment: dev
    data:
      vars:
        subPath: something
    ---
    apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
    kind: VirtualEnvironment
    metadata:
      name: dev-john
    spec:
      environment: dev
    data:
      vars:
        db: john
        subPath: john
```

Save your changes, and apply the updates.

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl apply -f hack/environments/ --namespace kubefox-demo
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev configured
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev configured
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev-john configured
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod configured
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod configured
    ```
Go back to the browser, and refresh the page.  This is the URL if you need it:

[http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page after dev yaml after subPath mod fail.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 35 - dev VE after modifying subPath and old URL</figcaption>
</figure>

We get "route not found" because the `dev` subPath no longer exists in any VE. We
need to use the `something` subPath instead:

[http://localhost:8080/something/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/something/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page after dev yaml after subPath mod success.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 36 - dev VE after modifying subPath and new URL</figcaption>
</figure>

The `something` subPath is now the correct path for the dev VE.  Note that KubeFox effected this change instantly.

Let's revert our change to the dev VE so we're back at our original baseline.
Edit the dev.yaml and return it to its original state:

```yaml linenums="9"
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Environment
  metadata:
    name: dev
  spec:
    releasePolicy:
      type: Testing
  data:
    vars:
      db: dev
      subPath: dev
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: VirtualEnvironment
  metadata:
    name: dev
  spec:
    environment: dev
  ---
  apiVersion: kubefox.xigxog.io/v1alpha1
  kind: VirtualEnvironment
  metadata:
    name: dev-john
  spec:
    environment: dev
  data:
    vars:
      db: john
      subPath: john
```

```{ .shell .copy }
kubectl apply -f hack/environments/ --namespace kubefox-demo
```

??? example "Output"

    ```text
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev configured
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev configured
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/dev-john configured
    environment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod configured
    virtualenvironment.kubefox.xigxog.io/prod configured
    ```
Our dev subPath should be back amongst the living.  Check it and make sure.

  <figcaption>Figure 37 - dev VE after we revert the 'something' subPath change</figcaption>
</figure>

If we look at the prod environment, we're reminded that it has a Stable release
policy. When we release to prod, KubeFox creates an immutable copy of the
environment variables, secrets and AppDeployment that is being released.  Any
changes won't go into effect until we release again. And it is required that we
have a versioned, tagged release if our policy is Stable.

Before we make changes, let's remind ourselves of what is runing in prod now.

  <figcaption>Figure 38 - prod VE before we release a new version</figcaption>
</figure>

It is our original version.

Okay, let's create our new version.  First we publish the new version.

```{ .shell .copy }
  fox publish --version v2 --create-tag
```

Let's go back to the browser and summarize our releases.

We'll start with the dev VE.

[http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/dev/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page dev summary.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 39 - dev VE summary</figcaption>
</figure>

The dev VE is running our current release with the original database.

Let's look at the dev-john VE.

[http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/john/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page john summary.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 40 - dev VE summary</figcaption>
</figure>

The dev-john VE is running our current release with the updated database (in which
you're still a superhero!).

And we're also running the current release with the original database in prod.

[http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes](http://localhost:8080/prod/hasura/heroes){:target="_blank"} 

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/Superheroes HTML page prod summary.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 41 - prod VE summary</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's jump back over to k9s.  If we look at our Pods (`:pods`), we can see that
we're still running the two graphql-server component Pods corresponding to the
two versions of our App.

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s Pods after v2 release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 42 - Active Pods after our v2 release</figcaption>
</figure>

If we look at our AppDeployments (`:appdeployments`), we see that there are 4
AppDeployments:

1. Our `graphql-main` deployment
2. Our first release AppDeployment `graphql-v1`
3. Our feature deployment `graphql-feature`
4. Our just-released AppDeployment `graphql-v2`

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s AppDeployments after v2 release.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 43 - Active Pods after our v2 release</figcaption>
</figure>

No one is using the `graphql-v1` AppDeployment anymore, so let's delete it:

1. Use the ++up++ or ++down++ arrow keys to highlight the `graphql-v1` AppDeployment
2. Hit ++ctrl+d++ to delete it

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s AppDeployments delete graphql-v1.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 44 - Delete the graphql-v1 AppDeployment</figcaption>
</figure>

3. Select OK ++arrow-right++
4. Hit ++enter++

<figure markdown>
  <img src="../../images/screenshots/hasura_tutorial/k9s AppDeployments after graphql-v1 delete.png" width=100% height=100%>
  <figcaption>Figure 45 - AppDeployment list after deletion of graphql-v1</figcaption>
</figure>

If we look at our Pods (`:pods`), we can see that KubeFox has distilled away the
original graphql-server Pod because no deployments remain that require it.

This is just one of the many ways that KubeFox helps control provisioning.

</figure>

## Cleanup

Once you are done with the quickstart, you can delete the Kubernetes cluster and
related resources created during the setup.

=== "Local (kind)"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    kind delete cluster
    ```

=== "Azure (AKS)"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    az group delete --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```

## Summary

We hope this tutorial provides you with a nice overview of the capabilities of
KubeFox, and an introduction (albeit a cursory one) to Hasura.

Explore the rest of the documentation for more details. If you encounter any
problems, you have any suggestions for improvement or you would like to get
involved, please let us know on [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/xigxog/kubeFox/issues).  We value your feedback!
